# Kentech Tutorial of Advancing Sustainability through Computational Chemistry Methods.

In today's advancing landscape of science and engineering,  computational methods have become an essential tool. With the advent of artificial intelligence and machine learning, their importance is only further heightened, where they are increasingly being used to make groundbreaking discoveries and advances.
This tutorial is a collaborative effort that showcases the work of undergraduate students of Kentech, with a focus on the computational elements of Chemistry and Energy Engineering. This document will be updated on a regular basis, reflecting the ongoing learning and innovative activities taking place at Kentech.
Yet, this tutorial is more than just a collection of academic activities. It is envisaged as a platform facilitating the exchange of knowledge and experiences amongst students. Through such discourse, I aspire to foster a positive and dynamic learning culture at Kentech. As we navigate this path of scientific exploration, we are committed to learning, sharing, and collectively evolving.
In the spirit of collaboration, all developed codes will be shared openly via GitHub, further enriching the learning experience and ensuring an open-source approach to our scientific journey.

```Monte Carlo simulation``` was developed through a CCP program entitled "Let's Roll a Dice: Monte Carlo Simulation 101" with the support of Kentech Residential College Education Center.
